        <h2>About Us</h2>   
        <p>Hapee-Ng was founded in the year 2018 by Dr. Maryann Bomlia, a renowned physician in gynaecology. She once said this:</p>
    <q>
        One would think being a gynaecologist well trained in her field would prepare me for menopause but the truth is no matter how prepared you think you are, the changes just hits you in various ways
    </q> 
    <p>Hapee-Ng was created with 3 main objectives in mind:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a safe space where women can talk about their premenopausal and menopausal journey without the usual hush feeling society sees it to be. This we do by creating support groups and forums where women bond, talk and just feel.</li>
        <li>Providing testing services and one-on-one consultantancy with our in-house resident physician</li>
        <li>Organizing seminars, webinars and talks to get the conversation rolling.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Julie Mathison</h2>

<p>Joining the online support group was the best thing I did this year. Not only has it provided me with an excellent support system, but also great friends I can vent to whenever my symptoms come knocking. Friends that understand. Every woman should join this group. I 100% recommend</p>

<h2>Junpie Mason</h2>
<p>When my menopausal journey started, I was scared and felt guilty for not being strong and handling it like I felt I should. I cried a lot and had not idea what to do. Hapee-ng has made me realize that it's ok to still be figuring it out. Once you join Hapee-ng, she becomes like this hand that quite never lets go of yours. Like this warm, bear hug.</p>
